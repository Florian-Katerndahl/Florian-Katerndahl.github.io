#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

After graduating from FU Berlin with a Bachelor of Science in Geography, I'm switched fields to Computational Sciences and enrolled in the corresponding Master at University Potsdam.

During my Bachelor, I focused on Remote Sensing and Earth Observation with particular interest in technical details underlying classical analysis methods. Developing small to mid scale software projects and publishing them freely on GitHub combines both hobby and study/work related interests.
